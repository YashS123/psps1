        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="smallhead2">The relays used in power system protection are of different types. Among them differential relay is very commonly used relay for protecting transformers and generators from localised faults.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="smallhead2">The differential relay is one that operates when there is a difference between two or more similar electrical quantities
        exceeds a predetermined value. In the differential relay scheme circuit, there are two currents come from two parts of
        an electrical power circuit. These two currents meet at a junction point where a relay coil is connected. According to
        Kirchhoff Current Law, the resultant current flowing through the relay coil is nothing but the summation of two
        currents, coming from two different parts of the electrical power circuit. If the polarity and amplitude of both the
        currents are so adjusted that the phasor sum of these two currents, is zero at normal operating condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereby there
        will be no current flowing through the relay coil at normal operating conditions. But due to any abnormality in the
        power circuit, if this balance is broken, that means the phasor sum of these two currents no longer remains zero and
        there will be non-zero current flowing through the relay coil thereby relay being operated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
        <br>
        <h1 class="tit2">Working of Percentage Differential Relays</h1>
        <br>
        <h1 class="smallhead2">In this type of relay, there are restraining coils in addition to the operating coil of the relay. The restraining coils
        produce torque opposite to the operating torque. Under normal and through fault conditions, restraining torque is 
        greater than operating torque. Thereby relay remains inactive. When internal fault occurs, the operating force exceeds
        the bias force and hence the relay is operated. This bias force can be adjusted by varying the number of turns on the
        restraining coils. As shown in the figure below, if I1 is the secondary current of CT1 and I2 is the secondary current
        of CT2 then current through the operating coil is I1-I2 and current through the restraining coil is (I1 + I2)/2. In
        normal and through fault condition, torque produced by restraining coils due to current (I1+ I2)/2 is greater than
        torque produced by operating coil due to current I1-I2 but in internal faulty condition these become opposite. And the
        bias setting is defined as the ratio of (I1-I2) to (I1+ I2)/2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="smallhead2">It is clear from the above explanation, greater the current flowing through the restraining coils, higher the value of
        the current required for operating coil to be operated. The relay is called percentage relay because the operating &nbsp;&nbsp;
        current required to trip can be expressed as a percentage of through current.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="smallhead2">The operating characteristic of the relay is shown in the figure below. The above graph shows that the ratio of their
        operating current and restraining current is fixed percentage. This relay is also called the biased differential relay &nbsp;
        because the restraining coil is also called a bias coil as it provides additional flux.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
